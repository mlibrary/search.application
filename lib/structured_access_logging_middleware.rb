  # The actual format is slightly different than the above due to the
  # inclusion of referer, user_agent, and elapsed time in seconds

  # Log all requests in common_log format after a response has been
  # returned.  Note that if the app raises an exception, the request
  # will not be logged, so if exception handling middleware are used,
  # they should be loaded after this middleware.  Additionally, because
  # the logging happens after the request body has been fully sent, any
  # exceptions raised during the sending of the response body will
  # cause the request not to be logged.
